Name:
    Breaking Bad

Description:
    The project is based on a very popular TV Series called Breaking Bad. It involves fetching data from the API (https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation) for different characters in the show, where we get their names, age, occupation and status.
    This project involves the use of the JavaScript library called React, and is a product of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Features:
    The project allows us to search for different characters based on their names, and is divided into multiple pages with equal number of grids on each page.
    Each grid shows the image of the character in the form of a card, which when hovered over, flips to give the required information about that character
